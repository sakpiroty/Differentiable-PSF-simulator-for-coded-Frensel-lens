# Differentiable PSF Simulator for Coded Fresnel Lens

This optical simulator is for a shadowless projector using coded large-aperture Fresnel lens.
The PSF of the Fresnel-lens based projector is simulated in differentiable manner, and the coded aperture of the lens is optimized in terms of deblurring and shadow suppression depending on the simulated PSF.
